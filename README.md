# Data-Visualization
We address the question of how the succes of a song can be defined using different factors by using three specific questions - what components share strong relationship with popularity, how each component evolves over time for each genre, and how composed music has changed over time? We examine the data for songs from spotifyâ€™ API that ranges from 1957 to 2020 with roughly 33000 songs and 23 variables. We use different visuals to solidify our conclusions. We find that speechiness, danceability, and energy share a strong and positive relationship with popularity, each component changes over time, and music composed today is different from what it was before the year 2000. The songs that could be successful cannot be generalized but can only be understood for current scenarios as music evolves over time.
